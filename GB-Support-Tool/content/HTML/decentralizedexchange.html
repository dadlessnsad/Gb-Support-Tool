            <h1>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</h1>
            <h2>What are DEXs?</h2>
            <p>Decentralized exchanges let users trade/swap cryptocurrencies on a peer-2-peer network allowing for transactions to take place securely with no need for an intermediary. They aim to try and solve problems that inherit from centralized exchanges. With no central authority, these exchanges do not require KYC (know your customer).</p>
            <h2>DeFi & DEXs</h2>
            <p>The massive boom for defi in 2020 led to the community making more products including DEXs. Uniswap was on the first big exchanges that were built on top of Ethereum. Today there are more options for user's including layer 2 protocols.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of DEXs</h2>
            <h3>Custody</h3>
            <p>DEXs are non-consortial, meaning users don't have to give the security of owning their own seeds/keys, to transact with the exchange.</p>
            <h3>Privacy</h3>
            <p>Users can trade without disclosing personal information.</p>
            <h3>Diversity</h3>
            <p>DEXs can give a user more access to an increased number of cryptocurrencies.</p>
            <h3>Trustless Transactions</h3>
            <p>Using smart contracts to process trades DEXs offer the ability to trade without having a central authority controlling the keys to your funds.</p>
            <h2>Disadvantages of DEXs</h2>
            <h3>Liquidity</h3>
            <p>DEXs are relatively new and don't have the same volume as bigger exchanges, leading to slippage.</p>
            <h3>Scalability</h3>
            <p>Due to DEXs having to run on a BlockChain they a limited to how many transactions per second there can be.</p>
