            <h1>Understanding Defi</h1>
            <h2>What is DeFi</h2>
            <p>DeFi stands for decentralized finance, is built of off-blockchain technology, which means there is no need for intermediaries (Banks, Brokers, and exchanges). Using blockchain and smart contracts allowing everyone to access traditional finance instruments (buying, selling, borrowing, lending) using peer-to-peer transactions.</p>
            <p>Most of "Defi" takes place on the Ethereum blockchain which is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Using smart contracts and a very unique programming language, allowing developers to make Dapps ( Decentralized Application), allowing users to execute smart contracts easily.</p>
            <p>This mean's that for a user to access "DeFi" protocols/services they would need to have Ether ($ETH) in their wallets. Because to transact with the network, you will need to pay a <a href="gasfees.html">Gas Fee"</a> which is measured in <a href="understandingeth.html">Gwei</a> a smaller unit of Ether.</p>
            <h2>Type of Dapps</h2>
            <h3>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</h3>
            <li>Are online exchanges that let users exchange currencies to other currencies either crypto or fiat. DEXs use peer-to-peer transactions securely without the need for intermediaries. The majority of the time DEXs don't need a KYC (know your customer).</li>
            <h3>Stablecoins</h3>
            <li>These are coins that are pegged to an asset outside of cryptocurrencies, like the U.S. dollar. using reserves and a collateral system to back up the said currency, a example is Maker Dao.</li>
            <h3>Lending Platforms</h3>
            <li>Uses smart contracts to eliminate the need for a bank that manages the lending as a middle man, allowing them to charge fees.</li>
            <h3>WBTC/WETH</h3>
            <li>Because Eth is not an ERC-20 standard like bitcoin, we have to "wrap" the coins. once wrapped they are an ERC-20 standard and can interact with Defi, & Dapps.</li>
            <h3>Staking</h3>
            <li>Staking uses a PoS blockchain instead of PoW blockchains. where the miners are just validators that process the transactions and earn rewards. This is considered a "Green Blockchain"</li>
            <h3>Yield Farming</h3>
            <li>Yield farming lets you lock up funds and earn rewards during the epoch. Employing defi protocols to access various interest pools as a liquidy provider.</li>
